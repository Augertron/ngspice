**************************** ngspice license **********************************

The ngspice source code has evolved over time by integrating contributions
from various sources (e.g. Spice3f5, XSPICE, CIDER, numparam, tclspice and
others). Thus a mixture of license statements prevails.

The ngspice license is the `Modified BSD' license. This is adopted for all of
its source code, test and example files except for the files listed below.
